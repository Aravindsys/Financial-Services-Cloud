FSC concepts:
A client can belongs to many group.
A group can contain number of client accounts.
A client can have only one primary group. A group can have only one primary member
The particular client data can be rolledup to only his/her primary group
A group can have only one primary member

to access group info about a client
account > record > relationships > 

to edit which objects to rollup or their sort order
go to object manager > account contact relationships > fields > rollups

Client List dashboard - one place shop to analyze the client data. Open this in tableau CRM
below this dashboard you can find table widget. All clients in this table have quick actions tied up to them. 
To customize those quick actions 
go to Account-Contact data set click the setup icon > search for field name > configure the quick actions that you want.

Person accounts: Combine Account and Contact fields into a single record.
In FSC, if you want to add record types and pagelayouts to the Account object, do that on Person Account Object
if recordtype is created but not added to the different pagelayout, then its not shown
to make them visible during creation
create record types and assign them the pagelayouts in Account
and follow the below step (highly required for FSC alone)
setup > custom meta data types > Individual/Group Record Type Mapper >
Manage Individual Record Type Mappers > new > and configure the record type mapping

A group can also have its related accounts and contacts
Household is the default group given by FSC
Person account is also default given by FSC

FSC also helps you to create Contact-Contact/Account-Account relationship with reciprocal role,
if one is made parent, then the other is automatically made as dependent

So in FSC alone, after creating the record type
go to setup > custom metadata types > Individual/Group record type mapper should be chosen
